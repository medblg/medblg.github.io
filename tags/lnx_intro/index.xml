      <description>What is the best Linux distro and for what? It’s a Linux myth question, though the response can easily find its way from the question. What are you willing to do with ? It’s really depends on what would be your engagement towards the OS (the uses). Are you using it just for daily browsing. For games, Programming and development stuff. Staring without doing anything ? Why not, it could be :)</description>

      <description>Why I use Linux ? It’s a great question. Almost every colleagues, friends that had chance to see me work with, keep asking why use it instead of Windows ?. Why getting things complexes ?. To be honest, it’s a matter of taste and how things should be done. (I have no problem with Windows, except security concern). For me I was experiencing Microsoft Windows since the XP version at the age of 11 year-old.</description>
