      <description>Intro: Back to Feb 1, 2020 at 5:53PM, I reported a critical vulnerability issue that gives me a remote code execution(RCE) on StrongKey company.

      <description>Sorry for the late, I wasn’t able to write this before. Academic exams were overwhelming as usual. Now, I got some time. Let’s start the (story)! One day, while doing my research as usual, I come across a web application that I (want) to test. Just curious, you know when a website pop up and you as usual with your hacker mind spirit want to test, just a small check list will be enough (as it wasn’t your target at first place).</description>
