      <description>Vulnerable discovered code LFI  Intro: Three years ago, while conducting my academic research. I come accross a website to download an interresting pdf course.
I downloaded the pdf, and as always, the nerd come back to mind whenever had the chance, even if it’s not the subject of my research. So, I tried to test the website for what it seems to me a vulnerability. And guess what? it’s a critical one.</description>
