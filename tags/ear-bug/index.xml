      <description>Intro: It has been a while since my last blog post, and here we go again. This one will cover a vulnerability I discovered and reported back in April to a private program in HackerOne which I cannot disclose the name, but it is a well known insurance company in the USA.
In short I have not set and prepare for this finding as I am so busy recently with my full time job, nevertheless I spend some of my spare time on my hobby, including research.</description>
